Welcome! My name is Caio, I'm 24 years old and I'm a Computer Engineering undergrad based in Praia Grande - SP (Brazil) :palm_tree:


- :bookmark_tabs: Currently studying __*Javascript*__ and __*Typescript*__ for web & mobile development.

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I have basic knowledge in MSSQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

- :space_invader: I create projects using __*ReactJS*__ and __*React Native*__ from time to time and I have created some desktop applications using __*C#*__ (WinForms) before landing on Github.

- :notes: I'm very inspired by _Drum n' Bass_ nowadays while not letting go my old passion for _Thrash Metal_ and other music genres (as you can see, my music taste can be pretty encompassing :joy:).

- :e-mail: Reaching me : you can always drop me a message at my e-mail or linkedin by clicking the buttons at the top of this doc. :blush:

- :fire: Fun facts & misc:
  - I love anime (fav is HxH).
  - I like old-school console RPGs (mainly Chrono Trigger, the Secret of Mana franchise and the FF franchise).
  - I like graphic design, illustration and photomanipulation. I generally like doing some montages and illustrations using Photoshop, it feels like a kind of therapy to me xd.
  - My username is 100f because the number 100 written in full in brazilian means 'Cem', so 100f becomes Cemf, which are the initials of my full name. :grin:

Thank you for reading this! :purple_heart:
